# FPHS-Programming-Club
Welcome to the FPHS Programming Club!

The FPHS Programming Club is a club at Forest Park High School that is currently a work-in-progress. We hope to create a club where you can easily learn most commonly-used programming languages with different types of development, including game design, web design, and more, in a safe and easily accessible community!


Meeting Types: Help (If someone needs help for programming in some way and is able to, stay after on Monday and come to Mr. Friebe's room to get help!) & "Official" (We will go over everyone's progress and do some programming. These are also days in which we will be able to help)

Current Schedule: Every other Friday from 2:15-3:15, Monday of that week for review

Next Review Day: Monday, March 6, 2023

Next "Official" Meeting: Friday, March 10, 2023
