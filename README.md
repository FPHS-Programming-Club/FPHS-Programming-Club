# FPHS-Programming-Club
Welcome to the FPHS Programming Club!

The FPHS Programming Club is a club at Forest Park High School that is currently a work-in-progress. We hope to create a club where you can easily learn most commonly-used programming languages with different types of development, including game design, web design, and more, in a safe and easily accessible community!


Meeting Types: Language (no more than 2 per year, currently probably doing C++) & Game Dev (We will be creating a game that we will try to push out at the end of the year)

Current Theme: Game Dev/Collab (Unity) on Fridays & Learning languages on Mondays

Current Schedule: Every other Friday from 2:15-3:15, Monday of that week
